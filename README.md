![covid19_2020_2_25](./covid19_2020_2_25.gif)

This animation shows the **"Confirmed"**, **"Discharged"** and **"Active"** COVID-19 cases in Singapore, as of 25th February 2020. It was created using the program `covid19_case_monitor.py`, which is written using [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/) & [Mathplotlib 3.1.3](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/index.html).

### Execution

 1. Clone / download this repository into a directory.
 
 2. Open a terminal and go to the same directory as used in step 1 and type:

    `$ python3.6 covid19_case_management.py`

The program will generate a `.gif` animation file of the confirmed and discharged case histories given in the files `Cases_Confirmed.txt`  and `Cases_Discharged.txt`. 

### Remarks

- We hope this program can help the current efforts in combating and understanding the COVID-19 epidemic.
